### TDD - Pair Programming
This project objective is to teach us two very important concepts of
software development while working on the fizzbuzz challenge:   
- Collaboration (Pair Programming)  
- Testing (TDD)  
I have enjoyed pairing with Sam Jones.  
We agreed that these concepts are very important as we were able to work
on the challenge very efficiently.  
 We noticed that while collaborating we are able to spot and to correct issues faster.
