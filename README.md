### TDD - Pair Programming
This project objective is to teach us two very important concepts of
software development while working on the fizzbuzz challenge:   
- Collaboration (Pair Programming)  
- Testing (TDD)  
I worked with  with Sam Jones and Justin Butwell.  
We agreed that even though, TDD value cannot be appreciated fully with fairly short code like the one we wrote, we are aware that the concept behind it is very sound.
 The real value of it will show clearly when we work on more difficult exercises and  projects.   
Nevertheless, we did notice that when working in pair, we are able to spot and correct issues more efficiently.
